# Tic-Tac-Toe
A text-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.
The user can play against a friend or the computer.
The player1 is always X and plays first.

Future development: 
* Implement a decision tree for the computer player instead of generating random numbers.
* Toss a coin to see who plays first instead of player1 always playing first.
